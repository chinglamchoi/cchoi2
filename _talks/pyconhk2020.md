In this talk, I will introduce my open source Python project, COVID-19 chest CT segmentation with PyTorch. I leverage the UNet model -- a Fully Convolutional encoder-decoder network -- for multi-class medical segmentation. Through UNet, I successfully detect and localise COVID-19 symptoms, including ground-glass, consolidation and pleural effusion, from axial chest CT slices, using open source datasets and annotations.
