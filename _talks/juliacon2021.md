This talk will describe work done using the NeuralNetDiffEq & Flux packages, as part of the Google Code In 2019 program, including writing a second order ODE solver. I will also talk about pursuing Julia beyond GCI, including how I used Julia to create Corona-Net, a binary and multi-class symptoms localisation system for COVID-19. Through this talk, I hope share on how GCI with Julia has accelerated my progress in ML, and how Julia can be used to help contribute to the fight against COVID-19.
