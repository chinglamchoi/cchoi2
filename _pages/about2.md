I am Ching Lam, a Year 1 Electronic Engineering student from The Chinese University of Hong Kong, passionate about fields of Computer Vision and Machine Learning. Since August 2019, I have been advised by Professor Li Hongsheng as a research mentee at CUHK's Multimedia Laboratory. Presently, I am also a research intern at the NVIDIA AI Technology Center Hong Kong (since May 2020), where I work on CV and multi-modal research, collaborating with Dr. Ming-Yu Liu, Dr. Arun Mallya and Dr. Ting-Chun Wang.

Academic Interests
======
I am fascinated by CV fields of generative models, self-supervised learning and meta-learning, as well as by ML concepts of explainability, robustness (distributional, adversarial). In particular, I am interested in multi-modally conditioned GANs for video generation, as well as unifying mathematical optimisation techniques and meta-learning to improve CNN interpretability and reprogramming/transfer ability.

Future Aspirations
======
Upon graduation in 2024, I am determined to pursue a PhD in Computer Science in the US/UK, delving deep into CV and ML research. During my PhD studies, I aim hone my instincts as a researcher, developing an intuition for ideas with great potential and the skills necessary to transform ideas into influential research.
  
I aspire to become a leading researcher in Artificial Intelligence (specifically Computer Vision (CV)) and am resolved to achieve this in the GBA. I plan to study CV sub-fields of generative models, multi-modal learning, unsupervised learning, to realise my ultimate goal of advancing GBA into a human-centred, technologically-unparalleled innovation-hub. 
  
Academically, I aim to enter top US/UK institutions for graduate-studies. To achieve my goal, presently in Y1, my first 3rd-authored paper was accepted into CVPR 2021 (premier CV-conference worldwide, ranks 5th in h5-index among all academic journals/publications of all disciplines). I am currently working on 2 research-projects for ICCV 2021 (2nd most prestigious CV-conference), on generative-models and robust representation learning to make AI models more imaginative and flexible in practical-settings. I am also taking ELEG5491, a postgraduate AI course in Y1, while maintaining a GPA of 3.925/4.0. At CUHK, I plan to collaborate even more with labmates at the Multimedia Laboratory and gain more top-tier conference research experience. This will qualify me for top graduate programmes, where I aim to study a PhD with some of the most prominent CV researchers. 
  
I believe that such an education will equip me with a unique-skillset and useful-connections which I will gladly bring-home to the GBA, such as connecting GBA researchers with those at top US/UK-institutions into bridge the knowledge-gap and create new-opportunities; sharing and adapting whatever I will pick up from overseas (e.g. research workflow, an open-collaboration culture) for the benefit of GBA. Back at GBA, I hope to take up an academic research position at a GBA university, to poise myself to utilise the abundant resources -- the hardware manufacturing prowess of Dongguan/Foshan, the high-tech software supremacy of Shenzhen companies -- in GBA to advance human engineering knowledge.

Last but not least, in terms of entrepreneurship, I am an aspiring social entrepreneur, passionate about enhancing the AI literacy of secondary school students in HK and the GBA. I have co-founded and currently lead my own organisation, AI Code-In, which conducts weekly introductory AI classes (covering NumPy, basic linear algebra, basic Tensorflow at the moment). At present, we are also recruiting NGOs to join our Microsoft HK-supported AI Code-In programme, where AI professionals mentor students in AI, and guide them to propose & implement tech adoption strategies for NGOs to maximise their social impact. After graduation, I am determined to continue and scale up (from HK to all of GBA) the operations of AI Code-In, allowing more students to become fluent in AI technology in preparation for the AI-centric future, and to empower GBA students and NGOs alike to leverage AI for social contributions.
