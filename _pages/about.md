I am Ching Lam, a Year undergraduate from [CUHK](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html) studying [AIST](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/admission/aistn/). Since 2019, I have been working with Professor [Hongsheng Li](https://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~hsli/) at CUHK's [Multimedia Laboratory](https://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/) (MMLab). From 2020 - 2021, I was a research intern at NVIDIA; at present, I am interning with Professor [Jiajun Wu](https://jiajunwu.com/) at the Stanford AI Lab (SAIL).

Academic Interests
======
I am fascinated by CV fields of generative models, representation & multi-modal learning and video understanding, as well as by ML concepts of explainability, robustness (distributional, adversarial), generalisation. In particular, I am interested in multi-modally conditioned GANs for video generation, as well as unifying mathematical optimisation techniques and meta-learning to improve CNN interpretability and reprogramming/transfer ability.

Future Aspirations
======
Upon graduation in 2024, I am determined to pursue a PhD in Computer Science in the US/UK, delving deep into CV and ML research. During my PhD studies, I aim hone my instincts as a researcher, developing an intuition for ideas with great potential and the skills necessary to transform ideas into influential research.
