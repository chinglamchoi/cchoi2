I am Ching Lam, a Year 3 undergraduate from [CUHK](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html) studying [AI Engineering](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/admission/aistn/), with a double minor in English and German. I will be applying for PhD positions in the 2024 fall entry season, to better understand robustness in computer vision (CV) and machine learning (ML).  

I've been incredibly fortunate to spend time with amazing people at exciting places. In 2023, I did a 3-month internship with [Wieland Brendel](https://robustml.is.mpg.de/) at TÃ¼bingen's Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems (MPI-IS); I will be interning with [Yann Dauphin](https://www.dauphin.io/) and [Aaron Courville](https://mila.quebec/en/person/aaron-courville/) at MILA from May-Aug. In 2022, I did a remote, 6-month internship with [Jiajun Wu](https://jiajunwu.com/) at the Stanford AI Lab (SAIL); I started as a research assisyant with CUHK's [Farzan Farnia](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~farnia/). From 2020 - 2021, I was a research intern at NVIDIA; from 2019 - 2022, I worked with my first-ever mentor, [Hongsheng Li](https://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~hsli/), at CUHK's [Multimedia Laboratory](https://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/) (MMLab).

Academic Interests
======
I am fascinated by the intersections between ML and CV, including reconciling the various definitions of "robustness". I want to tackle fundamental problems such as whether deep learning methods are generalizable learners, how we should define and design for explainable/ineterpretable models, and how to better understand learning dynamics under noisy, multi-agent settings (e.g. label noise, distributional shifts, adversarial training, knowledge distillation, federated settings). I deeply enjoy both theoretical/empirical research; I strive to connect theory and practice, by building theoretically sound and practically grounded models.
