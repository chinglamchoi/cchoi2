I am Ching Lam, a Year 2 undergraduate from [CUHK](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html) studying [AIST](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/admission/aistn/). Since 2019, I have been working with Professor [Hongsheng Li](https://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~hsli/) at CUHK's [Multimedia Laboratory](https://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/) (MMLab). From 2020 - 2021, I was a research intern at NVIDIA; in 2022, I have been interning with Professor [Jiajun Wu](https://jiajunwu.com/) at the Stanford AI Lab (SAIL). At present, I am working with Professor [Farzan Farnia](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~farnia/) at CUHK on theoretical machine learning, with a focus on adversarial attacks and robust learning. My idols in work and life are Professor Andrew Zisserman and Hugh Laurie; nothing brings me more joy than [A Bit of Fry and Laurie](https://youtu.be/U8ko2nCk_hE).

Academic Interests
======
I am fascinated by the intersections between ML and CV, including reconciling the various definitions of "robustness". I enjoy researching the properties of adversarial attack algorithms (Nash equilibrium, semantic locality, transferability/universality). In the future, I hope to further explore the notion of "robustness" by investigating different kinds of noisy learning (especially label noise, distributional shifts and federated settings). 

Future Aspirations
======
Upon graduation in 2024, I am determined to pursue a PhD in Computer Science in the US/UK, delving deep into CV and ML research. During my PhD studies, I aim hone my instincts as a researcher, developing an intuition for ideas with great potential and the skills necessary to transform ideas into influential research.
